# website (in process)
I’m in the process of creating my own personal website! I want to have About, Blog, Projects, and Fun sections on my website.

Theme:
I want this to be clean and minimal!

About:
Here I’m going to put a quick bio about myself, a picture, and link my resume and other links (github, depots, linkedin, soundcloud).

Blog:
Weekly posts of things going on in my life. Things I’m obsessed with lately (fashion, animals, memes). Random thoughts.

Projects:
Showcase all my projects that I have and provide links.

Fun:
This is like the misc. portion. Not sure what to put here. Maybe photography or music I like to listen to.
